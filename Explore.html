          <p id="story1" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;"><i><I><I><I>”</I>Well skin my scarp and call me a Fae but sugar I’m telling you this is what happened on that bright and joyous day”</I></I></i> exclaimed a Straad with long blonde hair.
<br><br>
            It started as a mild midsummer day that was full of intrigue and heat. As if the sun had extended her long, luscious, warm arms to wrap around my waist and pulled me close by the way of my hips. Baskin’ within her beauty, I found my mind wondering with thoughts of my Lord and Master, Davey Jones…what a wonderful enigma he would turn out to be. As I lay my naked body on the deck just outside my room to bask I heard the most beautiful, yet frightening voice my ears have ever had the unsatisfactorily disillusionment of hearing. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <sup>…Could it be?...</sup>
            <br><br>
            As my hand starts to wander up from my side, across my properly groomed thighs and further up...up so far as to finally be able to grasp and clutch my pearls. I GASP as I rise straight up, still clutching the pearls around my neck. I bow my head and my body raises to its knees. <i><I><I><I>”</I>Lord...I’m as grateful as a whore in a brothel on payday.”</I></I></i> I couldn’t breathe, my heart was pounding, my hands had become weak and numb... Sugar, I was as frigid as a winter wolf and crazy as a blighted bat... <br><br>The voice called to me again... <b><I><I><I>”</I>Ian...I have come for you.”</I></I></b> <br><br>Oh, happy day...happy day pumpkin...this was it...time to make my way to the locker. 
            <br><br>
            I jumped to my feet and turned with so much excitement that my hair twirled around my face and my eyes were the size of copper coins... I stretched out my arms, bearing my entire exposed body to my Lord and Master, <sub>Davey Jones</sub>... Sugar my body was as hot as two ratlings fucking in a wool sock, for this was my time... The voice said again… <I><I><I>”</I>CAPTAIN!”</I></I> but this time with more intensity and sparks... As I close my eyes and throw my head back to accept and relish in the servitude of my Lord I feel my body wrapped in warmth, as if Davey Jones himself had wrapped me in his jacket... as I hug the clothing tight, breathing deep, smiling from ear to ear I feel it… 
            <br><br>
            Right across my face... a slap... I was shook... I was shocked... Well Sugar, I was plain stunned. As my eyes open, I hear that same voice <i><I><I><I>”</I>Captain, you’re overheating. I think you have sun poisoning.”</I></I></i> The voice sounded a little different, a little more concerned and higher pitched than before. I was as lost as a fart in a hurricane; what could possibly be happening? <i><I><I><I>”</I>Take this, it’s an antidote.”</I></I></i> 
            <br><br>
            The strange concoction moseyed down my throat, and as my eyes became clear, standing before me was my mate, one of my closet and truest friends. <I><I><I>”</I>Rosa, Pumpkin, I thought you were Davey Jones.”</I></I> I said as we both shared a good ole laugh... Sugar, good friends and antidotes are what gets me through this world. Bye bye for now dumplings!

        <p id="story2" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">Dear Mom,
<br><br><i>
          I know you will never get to read this.
          <br> However, it seems like a good way to cope with the fact that you’ve been gone eight years now. I wish I could just sit down and talk to you about my problems and what’s going on in my life. <br>Where do I start? I guess with the fact that I found Scurra... He truly is a joke mother. I swear I’ve never met someone who is so incredibly selfish, vile, and stupid... He acts as though he's a gift to humanity when in actuality he’s almost as bad as the blight... I can’t believe my father made me come find him... <br>But enough about that imbecile. Since I came back to Aftermath I started seeing this boy named Hannibal. He treated me rather well but he had a secret. He was only Hannibal at night... When the sun came up he was almost a different person entirely and went by Jack. Almost no one in Aftermath knows his secret. Jack wanted to become a knight so Scurra forbade the relationship from continuing... I was rather sad to see it end. <br>Shortly after I met a Straad named Trip. He is the most amazing person, mother but, he has a terribly haunted past. He treats me like a queen mother. You would have loved him. He rescued me from having to stay with Scurra and protects me during battles here. Mother I think I’d like to marry him... <br>I've also made some new friends around town. So far Monty is one of my favorites. He’s an elf and REALLY cool. I’ve also become fond of a wolf named Aa'shian and a human named Drake. They’ve become really good friends of mine. I plan on joining the mage's guild soon as well.<br><br> Hopefully I’ll become powerful like you were. Well... that’s all that’s happened really... I love and miss you dearly mother.
          <br><br>
          Love Always,</i>

      <div class="container-fluid">
      <p id="story3" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;"><I><I><I>”</I>We’re not supposed to remember”</I></I> my brother kept muttering to himself. He and three others had just resurrected after going on a short expedition east of Aftermath. I came in as the last person resurrected. All four were in a shocked state of mind. My brother Floki was not responding to anyone or anything, he just kept muttering to himself over and over again. One of the men was hiding under a bed. 
        As I approached him he retreated further under the bed and whispered <I>"Pippen!”</I></I> I stooped down and crawled closer to him. ”</I></I>Pippen, hide!”</I></I> I looked into his eyes, and they were vibrating out of fear. <I>"What happened out there?”</I></I> I asked him with a soothing voice. He stared at me for a long time, almost like he was trying to get his memories in order. <I><I><I>”</I>We went to the swamps to see why the Blight was so concentrated in that area.”</I></I> <br><br>
        He paused to try to get his voice under control. Taking a slow breath, he continued. <I><I><I>”</I>We were prepared for the Blight, but something else was in there with us. It tore us apart.”</I></I> He started to sob. I grabbed the back of his head and put my forehead against his. <I><I><I>”</I>You are safe now.”</I></I>, I told him. <I><I><I>”</I>What attacked you and the others?”</I></I>, I asked. He got his sobbing under control enough to say <I><I><I>”</I>It was a bi-pedal humanoid lizard creature. It wore clothes like a man and had a gator style tail.”</I></I> He stopped as if he was remembering. <br><br>
        His breathing became rapid. <I><I><I>”</I>Its claws were black. Its skin was scaly and different colors. Please help me forget this!”</I></I> I nodded in understanding, then crawled out. <I><I><I>”</I>Guild Mistress, can we get a necro here and Fugue them? What kind of creature has the power to force you to remember being killed?”</I></I> The guild mistress’s expression appeared deep in thought. Raising an eyebrow and pursing her lips she replied, <I><I><I>”</I>None that I have encountered.”</I></I> I let a sigh out before I spoke again. <I><I><I>”</I>Should I go warn people about the swamp?”</I></I> She nodded in agreement as she called out to someone to fugue the four men. <br><br>
        I made my way out the guildhall and to the tavern where most townsfolk would be during this time of day. As I opened the door, I was met by some of the heroes that called themselves town guards. <I><I><I>”</I>Ah, just the fellows I was looking for. We have a report of a dangerous lizard creature near the town. From what was reported it may be too much for just you lot. We may need to get the town together to keep them safe.”</I></I> The men laughed me off in their drunken state. I rolled my eyes and mouthed ‘worthless’ with my lips. 
        I entered the tavern and saw a group of pirates and brothel workers sitting at a table drinking and talking about something I probably needed to hear the beginning of to understand. I greeted them with a wave and a smile, then turned to the barkeep. <I><I><I>”</I>Hey, got some news the Healers Guild needs spread,”</I></I> I told him everything then asked him to tell them to stay in big groups until we can handle the situation. He nodded and asked what have I eaten for the day. After answering ‘nothing’ he scolded me and gave me some rat meat on a stick and some watered-down wine. <br><br>
        After a few minutes of sitting with the barkeep, my brother came in and sat next to me. <I><I><I>”</I>So I hear the whole expedition got killed and gave us some pretty bad rez sickness.”</I></I> I laughed at the rez sickness remark then replied, <I><I><I>”</I>Had to crawl under a bed to find one of y’all. But with all joking aside we need to prepare. We are not too well known and people don’t trust us enough to let us walk around with them.”</I></I> <br><br>
        He nodded and gave me a look that said, ‘no it’s you that don’t trust people enough’. I knew the look well. Before we came here we were living in Blight safe areas and always on the move. He was small, ten years my younger. He didn’t remember the hardships we faced, the people that used us, and robbed us. I had been seeing that very look more than normal after he joined the expedition group. He liked being part of the pack; I was a bit of a lone wolf. <br><br>
        Later that day just before dusk I started to help the Healers Guild with fortifying their hall. We boarded the windows as we’d been doing every night since more deadly creatures had been coming to town at night. I kept telling the overseer it had to be the lights that were attracting the monsters. According to him, it was the absence of Blight that drew them to town, and the nocturnal creatures were always stronger. We barred the door with a six by six beam. It was pretty heavy, so it took two strong guys to lift it. It did its job very well; they said the guildhall had never been attacked. Only members could sleep there and, well, I was not a member. <br><br>
        So I made my way out and to the barracks where us nobodies lived. I armed myself with a large boat oar I brought from my home village. It was covered in symbols I burned into it. Even the city’s symbol. I was sitting on my bunk as my brother and the others came in. They all armed and armored themselves. <I><I><I>”</I>New armor?”</I></I> I asked them. My brother turned to look at me as he buckled up the leather armor. <I><I><I>”</I>Yeah, the Armorsmiths Guild gave us all new gear. It’s not much but we are quickly becoming known around town.”</I></I> 
        The one guy I talked to under the bed looked over to me <I><I><I>”</I>Yeah Pip, you should join us. We want to form our own guild.”</I></I> My brother looked at him smiling, giving him a wink. <I><I><I>”</I>He’ll join.”</I></I> The group all started to bother at me with friendly remarks. Then all at once the fires throughout the city magically, alchemically, or naturally died out. The town went into a panic. Even the moon’s light that was normally produced was not giving us light even though we could see it in the sky. We all headed outside to see what all the commotion was all about. <br><br>
        Very little could be seen outside, even less indoors. We all waited, thinking our eyes would adjust but they never did. My brother spoke to the groups. <I><I><I>”</I>We need to keep an eye ou…”</I></I> Something interrupted him as he saw something coming from around the barracks. We all turned to look at what caused him to pause. The creature stepped onto the concrete pathway between the barracks and the wood line. It moved slowly, with heavy steps and sporadic movements. It paused by the door facing us. We couldn’t get a look at its face, but we could tell it had multiple colored scale patches all through its face. <br><br>
        The lizardman lunged at the group, attacking us. The first person he went for was one of our monks. He fended the creature off decently but still took a hit. And one hit was enough. The monk’s arm was shredded from the elbow to the wrist. He retreated as the rest of us began to attack the creature. We surrounded it, and two of us at a time would strike from opposite sides. This only worked once as the second time we tried it, he grabbed a sword that was thrust into him. He pulled in his attacker by the sword and forced him to the ground. We all took advantage of this and began to attack it again. <br><br>
        The attacks did not seem to faze him as he dug into his victim like a dog would dig a hole. He ripped out everything from the lungs to the groin. We all backed off as we all noticed our friend laid in a bloody mess. The creature was solid red now, covered in blood. It stood as it looked for its next target. We all watched in terror as the creature’s wounds healed before our eyes. Each one of the guys started to run, realizing we would need help. The creature got another one of us as we started to run. Only three of us were left, we ran towards the guild halls. <br><br>
        There was a group of people outside the guildhall trying to get the lamps relit with no success. We ran past them yelling at them. <I><I><I>”</I>Go inside!”</I></I> They noticed our panic but did not react fast enough. The creature stalked forward, causing everyone outside to scream and run. Blood and body parts went flying everywhere. Only a few got away from the creature’s onslaught. The guildhalls were next. The creature tore through the door like it was wet paper. As this was going on, the remaining members of the group and I got into our barracks. <br><br>
        I looked to the group <I><I><I>”</I>Open the back door, then hide inside.”</I></I>  My brother looked to me. <I><I><I>”</I>when it gets through the door, I’ll run out the back leading it back out to the swamps. I’m fast, it won’t catch me.”</I></I> I nodded in agreement and then got under my bunk. The other guy got on his bunk with a shield and short sword. The creature took its time getting to our barracks, and once it got inside it spotted my brother and stalked him outside. Not long after it left it returned with my brother’s corpse. I could hear bones snapping and flesh-tearing. Then my heart sank as I heard my brother moan. <br><br>
        I knew we could resurrect but we know we can only do it so many times before we are gone forever. This would be his fourth time resurrecting in two months. Knowing he may not come back I jumped up screaming and started throwing things at the creature. It stopped eating and smiled at me. Its face was the most terrifying thing I had ever seen. Its teeth were short and razor-sharp; its scales were purple, yellow, red, and dripping with blood. Its claws were two to three inches long, black, and curved. It was wearing tattered clothes like it was once more than just a killing machine. <br><br>
        I grabbed my boat oar and cracked it over the head of the creature. It went down from the blow. I cried out, hoping to get someone’s attention <I><I><I>”</I>Help, we got some hurt in here! I think the creature is dead.”</I></I> Some members of the healers guild ran in after a few minutes and managed to heal my brother… and then the creature started to laugh. I grabbed my brother’s hand and ran. The other member of our group that were left came with us. As soon as we got behind the barracks we could hear the creature killing the few members of the healers guild that came to our rescue. We could see our other members that had gotten separated sneaking between the barracks and the guild halls. <br><br>
        My brother threw one of his daggers at their feet. Seeing the dagger, they ran to us, staying in the shadows. Then together we fled into the forest thinking we would have a better chance of surviving there. <I><I><I>”</I>We need to come up with a plan.”</I></I> the monk said as he looked around, arm limp at his side. <I><I><I>”</I>A trap?”</I></I> I asked. My brother started grabbing long thick sticks. <I><I><I>”</I>I think we would have a better chance of killing it if we can keep it out of range.”</I></I> he said. The others agreed and started making wooden spears. It did not take long to make them and after a few minutes we had made two apiece. We left the spears scattered around where we planned on fighting the creature. Then two of us left to find the creature. <br><br>
        My brother and I made our way back to where we saw it last. Inside the guild halls was a gory mess, blood coated the entire inside of the building. Body parts were everywhere. We continued looking for the creature and finally found it in the tavern. We beat on the windows to get its attention then ran to the wood line. It followed us, almost getting to us before we got to our place where we had planned the attack. I slowed down and grabbed the spear, planting the flat side in the ground. As soon as I got it planted it found its mark. Right in the stomach of the creature. Its momentum forced the spear to go through the creature. 
        The creature tried the break the spear but the others started to attack it as well until it was restrained. The creature seemed to be lifeless as we studied it. <I><I><I>”</I>It looks like a lizardfolk but with more scales.”</I></I>, the monk said. I looked at it, nodding <I><I><I>”</I>what should we do now?”</I></I> My brother started to gather firewood and pine needles. <I><I><I>”</I>Burn it”</I></I>, he said. We all helped gather firewood then we lit it up. It started and we watched him burn. After a while, he dissipated. We saw the lights of the town come back to life. 
        We sat for a while, watching the fire. All feeling proud of saving the city. We all laughed and started to brighten, having a good time. Then we all headed back to the city as it got close to dawn. <br><br>
        But as we were walking, we were ambushed yet again by the creature. It was alive. It killed my brother and the monk right away, crushing their heads together. Brain matter and blood flew through the air. I sank to the ground at the sight, watching as the creature ripped the two apart limb by limb. I found myself petrified. I couldn't move. The creature stalked over to me and kneeled on me, knee pressed into my chest. I asked it, <I><I><I>”</I>What are you!?”</I></I> <br><br>
        It sneered at me, and then roared its response <I><I><I>”</I>SEVER!”</I></I> as it plunged its clawed hand into my gut and tore out my intestines. He made a slipknot out of them and then wrapped it around my neck. Gagging and coughing as I started to fade, I could feel him hoist me up a tree by my innards. Everything went silent as my vision finally faded. <br><br><br>

    <div class="container-fluid">
    <p id="story4" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">Most Hoblings are early to rise. Generations of preparing meals for the family early in the morning turned Hoblings into morning creatures. Rosa wakes at roughly 10am. She has no family to prepare food for. The sole other occupant of the house was Pudge, though they’re currently asleep under the table. Still under the same pile of moss that slightly smells of booze. <br><br>
      She grabs some dried food and begins her day. Her first stop today; The Orphanage. Adonis has been staying there more to help watch over the 25 children. Some are practicing their fighting skills while others are helping the few adults that volunteer their time. The adults are not always there, as these ladies' nights are spent at the Brothel. Though it does seem they are always happy to help a small child no matter how late their night was. Other children tend to the small cuts and bruises children often sporadically and mysteriously receive. These were the ones she was personally training. Mostly healers, but with some young alchemists as well. Maybe if she did not finish her work, one of these young minds would take over. Something to muse on later. <br><br>
      These 5 were the ones who helped the healers a couple of times a week. A deal struck with Guilder leader Nye. Most only tended to minor wounds, but it seemed to help the spirits of the citizens. She would need to visit Gamor, a star pupil who was quickly excelling in the art of healing, but that would need to come at a later time. Today she was only stopping by to check on them and see if any supplies were needed. After getting the list from Adonis, she makes her way to town. <br><br>
      In the Crafters District is her first stop. She needs to check on her shop, the Rose Garden. It has taken time, with a major setback during the food storage, but it should be ready to be a shop soon. Selling herbal remedies to the city of Aftermath. A quick drop to make sure the oils, lotions, herbs, medicines and other concoctions are coming along or ready to sell and then it is off for errands. The first stop being Vren’s fur shop to drop off the cough medicine for the older fur dealer, and buy some pelts before the cold of winter sets in. A stop at the butcher down the road to see if he has any smoked meat for an afternoon snack. Flank, a hobbling, has done well for himself, and he also has some of the best meats in the district. A quick conversation and a trade of food for coin and Rosa is on her way. A few more stops and then it is time for the main plans of the day. <br><br>
      Excitedly making her way into the ██████ District, she goes down the ████ passing the ever-watchful ████████████. Finally making it to the ██████████████. Making sure to grab the ███████████████████████████████████████████████. Finally, the familiar scents of the guild meet her nose. It was always a little different each day, but there was still a familiarity to it. She proceeds past the █████ to say hello to █████. He has tremendously helped her on her path to becoming the Master Alchemist she is today. She also made sure to say hello after the incident with the ███████ made from the ██████████████ of the dead █████████. Never even fathoming the possibilities of the fungal head she brought in months back. The incident with the █████ made a<br><br>
      stressful, but fond memory. When she had first gotten there to help Alvin, the other guild members were making bets on how bad the experiment went and if █████ would even live. With the help of some well-placed salt, disaster was averted. Now with the experiment under control, many of the members had taken to making █████ with the hard, but flexible █████..<br><br>
      She made her way to her station. Finding all her things in order, as it is highly frowned upon to touch another guild member’s experiments without due cause, she begins her work. She had lots of plans on some new and old experiments. She needed to research █████████████████████████████ and had thoughts on what how to fix the issue with the only █████. She spends hours figuring out how ██████████████████████ and █████████████████████████ worked together to make a better version of ████████████. Jotting down notes on how ██████████████████████ do not work well with ████████████████████. At one point another member makes his way over. ████████████████ seemed to enjoy making her life harder, though he calls it more interesting. It had taken weeks to calm everyone down after he insinuated she was in a relationship. He thankfully moves past, more important business than harassing her today. <br><br>
      She continues her work. Getting very promising results on distilling the already created ████████████ and the ██████████████████ formula obtained from █████████████. Only when she stops to get more ink is when she realizes how hungry she is. The meat and fruit were long gone. What time is it? She makes her way to look outside. Completely dark. It happened again. Sighing, she goes to clean up. She would need to get food at the tavern after cleaning up. It was the only place she felt safe enough getting food at this hour. The walk back to her place would be dangerous. Though nothing she was not accustomed to, she didn’t look forward to it. She goes to leave, but Anissa’s voice stops her. An invitation for a late dinner and some catching up. An invitation taken. The yellow and blue Lizardkin had been working overtime since the ████████████████. Anissa deserved a small reprieve and Rosa’s tummy never turned down food. She would stay the night at the guild, as she had done many nights before, and give Adonis his supplies on her way back home. Tomorrow.

  <div class="container-fluid">
  <p id="story5" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">
    In addition to his normal nocturnal business, Crizon would patrol some of the nearby areas that were often neglected by the town guard. Little alleys and nooks that were easily overlooked but would make great places for a thief or bandit to assault a passing by towns person. Though the heroes of the city were not often seen as <I><I>”</I>heroes”</I> by some of the locals, Crizon did what he could to protect anyone who called Aftermath their home. But he did not do so alone. <br><br>
    A raven whose jet-black feathers gleamed with a purple hue called out softly as it circled from above and descended towards him. These intelligent and loyal birds were Crizon’s choice of animal to handle. Easily trained and devoted to their task, the ravens of this place were ideal for reconnaissance, much like the eagles of his homeland. Two more soft cries had come from the raven, now perched on his shoulder. <I><I>”</I>That fool is up to no good again.”</I>, Crizon murmured to himself and then gestured forward with his staff. The purple hued raven took flight and clicked with its beak. From the shadows four more jet-black ravens glided silently in the noted direction joining their leader. Crizon smirked at the additional help his winged charge had gathered. <br><br>
    <I><I>”</I>Now for the fun part.”</I> Crizon loved any chance to be thematic when doing magic, even if no one saw him. Crossing his hands over his chest, Crizon’s eyes began to glow a faint purple as he muttered the words of power: <I><I>”</I>I call upon the forces of the Earth to shroud me in mist.”</I> Starting with his feet, Crizon’s body began to dissolve into a white mist, his faint glowing eyes lingered for a moment before they too dissolved. The mist moved as if carried by a slight but swift breeze down the alley in the direction of the gliding ravens. <br><br>
    <I><I>”</I>Steady now”</I>, said the bandit to his thug. <I><I>”</I>Don’t jump at her until I give the signal. She has to get closer.”</I> The bandit and his thug had been sitting still in the shadows of the alley in hopes that an unlucky passerby would venture close. This night seemed to be their lucky night. The young maiden had just left the Healer’s Guild and was most likely carrying healing potions, food, or coin, any of which could have been easily traded for a fair amount of Rat Bite in the slums. <I><I>”</I>Get ready, lad.”</I>, he sneered to his accomplice as the young maiden stepped near. <br><br>
    <I><I>”</I>Caaaw!”</I> The maiden paused suddenly and gasped as she looked up at the rooftops towards where the sudden call of the raven had broken the silence of the dark street. Fluttering down, the raven landed a few feet away. It moved on the ground as if it were injured before rolling over onto its back, kicking its feet up in the air, and looked at the young maiden as it forced out a pathetic little <I><I>”</I>caaw”</I>. Smiling, she stepped towards the winged creature and away from the alley. <I><I>”</I>Hello there, little one.”</I>, she bent down by the raven taking note of his purple hued feathers. <I><I>”</I>Have one too many drinks as the tavern?”</I>, she laughed. The raven cooed and fluffed his feathers taking on the behavior of a house cat more so than a bird. Hopping up on its feet the raven waddled off, away from the alley. <I><I>”</I>Where are you off too, little one?”</I>, said the young maiden as she followed behind the strange jet-black bird. 
    <I><I>”</I>Oh, no! She’s slipping away!”</I>, said the bandit as he watched his prey stroll off after a ridiculous bird had stopped her short of being within their grasp. <I><I>”</I>I say we run out and grab her. A pretty little piece like that’ll make a good slave for the right buyer, that is if she’s not damaged too much after we’ve put her to work for a while.”</I>, said the thug as a sneer appeared on his face. <I><I>”</I>Yea, think of all the Rat Bite we can get from selling her.”</I>, replied the bandit. <I><I>”</I>Get ready to run out and grab what’s ours then, lad!”</I>, said the bandit as he drew a rusty dagger from his belt. The thug nodded and did the same. <I><I>”</I>On Three. One… Two...”</I> <br><br>
    A sudden and cold breeze pressed by the two men startling them from behind and stealing their attention. They quickly turned back to face the darkness, knives raised, looking for the source of the sudden breeze. For a long moment there was no sound except the racing of their heartbeats in their ears. A few meters away in the shadows, two soft glowing purple orbs appeared followed by the archaic muttering of words of power: <I><I>”</I>I raise a wall of thorns, impeding all passage.”</I>, as nearly all light from the road was blocked out. Even if the young maiden had turned around, she would have seen only a wall of thorns where the alley had once been. 
    <I><I>”</I>Cullas. Up to your old habits again, I see? Oh, and this time you brought a friend. He looks rough, and you look like shit. Obviously, the Rat Bite market has been good to you.”</I>, Crizon eyed the two men as he stepped forward into what remained of the light. <I><I>”</I>Who is this prat, Cullas?”</I>, barked the thug. Cullas’ expression grew focused and a crazed look filled his eyes. <I><I>”</I>Crizon. Oh, I had hoped I’d see you again… after what you did to me last time. I hoped to get another go at you. And it’s like you said, this time I’ve got a friend. Two against one… odds are in my favor and I won’t be showing you any mercy.”</I> 
    Cullas lunged forward branding his rusty dagger, Crizon stepped to the side and swept his staff low, tripping Cullas and pushing him towards a pile of debris. The thug attacked from behind but his blade deflected off of Crizon’s armor. Crizon swung his staff but missed as the thug dodged his attack and moved out of range of the staff. Cullas, having regained his stance, again rushed forward yelling, <I><I>”</I>I’ll gut you, you bastard!”</I> <br><br>
    Quickly, Crizon called upon his magic, eyes glowing purple, and speaking the words of power: <I><I>”</I>I call upon the light of day to illuminate my path.”</I>, summoned a light that shone directly into Cullas’ face. Though it was not bright, it did its job of disorienting the attacker and causing him to stumble back. Crizon rushed forward, this time knocking the rusty dagger out of Cullas’ hand and, with a swing of his staff, knocked the bandit to the ground. <I><I>”</I>Caaw!”</I>, the warning came. Crizon whirled around just as the thug reached him. He used his staff to block the thug’s dagger as it plunged down, but the sharp pain in his stomach revealed that a second dagger in the thug’s other hand had found its mark. <br><br>
    The pain was intense and deep and the thug’s smug look added an extra sting. The thug disengaged and Crizon stepped back, pulled the rusted blade from his gut and flung it to the ground. Weakened, Crizon went down on one knee. <I><I>”</I>Looks like this is not your night. I told you, you were outnumbered.”</I>, smirked Cullas as he walked forward, his dagger back in his hand and ready to end the fight. <I><I>”</I>Any last words?”</I>, Cullas gleamed as he raised his dagger. Crizon smiled and simply said, <I><I>”</I>I’m not outnumbered.”</I> 
    Ravens swooped down and attacked the two men’s faces, scratching and pecking at their eyes. Panicking at the onslaught, Cullas and the thug dropped their daggers to protect their faces. Grabbing his staff Crizon rose up slowly whiile holding his stab wound, and knocked the daggers out of reach of the men. The ravens retreated, leaving the two men stammering and holding their wounded faces. Eyes glowing purple, Crizon spoke the words of power: <I><I>”</I>I pin you to the very earth.”</I>, and summoned magic that restrained Cullas to the ground, holding him tight, arms down so he could watch. <br><br>
    Walking slowly to the thug, Crizon reached out and grabbed him by the throat. Most of the thug’s right eye was gone and his left eye was bleeding. Crizon lamented at the nearly blind thug, <I><I>”</I>You, Sir, are the worst of us. The very type of citizen that Aftermath can do without. You would have harmed that young maiden then sold her to the highest bidder. The medicine she carried would have not reached its destination, causing others to suffer both physically and emotionally when they learned of her fate.”</I> <I><I>”</I>Yea… I take what I can get from this shit heap of a city…”</I>, spat the thug as the sneer appeared on his face again, <I><I>”</I>And she would not have been the first gal I’ve tortured. I like it when they try and get away... but they don’t get far.”</I>, he laughed menacingly. 
    Crizon was silent and stood motionless. He was not use to brazen admissions of such vile acts. <I><I>”</I>Well…”</I>, Crizon said as he glanced down at his stab wound then back at the thug, <I><I>”</I>I think I have found a better use for men like you.”</I> He held the man’s throat tightly and his eyes flared a brilliant purple as he spoke the words of power: <I><I>”</I>With the power of Necromancy, I drain the soul of the living.”</I> The thug wailed and screached as green mist emanated from his body and merged into Crizon, healing the stab wound he had sustained in the fight. But as Crizon’s wounds healed, the thug’s body weakened. Even after his wounds completely healed, Crizon kept the spell going, draining the soul and body from the thug. <br><br>
    As Cullas watched in horror, his friend’s hair turned grey, his eyes sank in and hollowed until only a withered husk of the thug remained. Crizon released the corpse to the ground then turned to Cullas whose eyes where wide with terror. Silent and still, Crizon stared at the bandit for a moment before whispering softly in his ear, <I><I>”</I>Aftermath will be saved… I’ll come for you soon.”</I> Once again Crizon crossed his arms and dissolved into mist, his purple orbs lingering for a moment before dissolving and drifted away on a swift breeze. Cullas sat motionless even as one by one the ravens landed near the remainder of his friend’s corpse to finish the meal their master had left for them.

    <sub>Edited by: Carmen Kates</sub>
    </b></button>
  <div class="container-fluid">
  <p id="story6" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">People have been coming to this city for as long as I can remember. Special people of so many different races, mysterious backgrounds, and unusual personalities. Some of these people do magic, while others are uniquely talented with fighting and weapons, but one thing they always have in common is that when they die, they come back to life. Some die a bit more than others, and on very rare occasion some have died and never come back. That is an unusual occurrence. The other citizens in town have started calling these new people <I>”</I>rezzies” because they resurrect, and they tend to not like the rezzies very much at all.
    <br><br>
    I think the rezzies are amazing! My parents tell me I should stay away from them and ignore them, but I want to be just like them. How did they know they could come back from the dead? Did they know before they died the first time? I have so many questions for them, and I listen to them whenever they're around. They speak all manner of strange things, about far off places, people I don't know, even monsters I've never even heard of. Their lives seem so interesting compared to my dull life. My parents would scold me if they knew how much time I spent listening to the rezzies and dreaming of being one.
    <br><br>
    Not too long ago, I found one of my father’s hunting knives and decided to learn to fight like the rezzies. I've seen some of them without any weapons at all, but that usually means they have magic or potions. I swiped a few books when they weren't looking, and I learned that I couldn't even do the simplest of spells, and the potions recipes looked way too dangerous. I decided that I'd learn to fight with my knife for now, and then later I'd save enough coins to buy myself a small sword. Fighting side by side with my heroes... what a dream! I'll do anything to make that my reality.
    <br><br>
    Monsters attack the town almost constantly these days, but the rezzies always fight them off. It happens so frequently that I can practice on the sidelines. I've copied the fighters as best as I could, and I've watched some of them sneak up and take out enemies with one swift strike between the shoulder blades. I stumbled and faltered at first, but after a while I could feel myself getting faster and stronger. Every spinning jump began to feel more fluid. Practiced thrusts and parries became predictable. I knew my skills as a fighter were getting better.
    <br><br>
    It wasn't too long after that a group of monsters strolled into town. The rezzies quickly jumped to action, and the whole lot of them spread out and divided amongst themselves, a good plan on the monster’s side. One sly creature decided to try to get the upper hand on a couple of rezzies by sneaking down a side alley out of their view, but little did he know that he would run into me instead! I crouched behind a large wooden barrel, knife in hand, and I knew in my bones that I was ready to face him. As his shadow cast over my barrel, I jumped out from behind to confront my foe.
    <br><br>
    He was a grotesque creature, tall and beastly. His hot, stinking breath filled my nostrils as he loomed over me, and I had to stifle the urge to retch at his feet. He was several heads taller than me, but that didn't matter in the slightest. He would make a lovely thud when he fell. With a growling smirk, the creature lashed at me with sharp, yellowed claws. I easily dodged his swing as being light-footed and quick on my toes was the very first thing I mastered. I lunged at him from the side, and my steel tasted its first drops of blood! Blood spurted from his forearm as he bellowed in pain. A cocky grin spread across my face as my confidence grew tenfold. I flourished as I attempted to dodge his next attack, but this time he made contact. A sharp pain radiated across my shoulder blades as his razor sharp claws tore through my cloak and met soft flesh, and through the ringing in my ears I heard someone shriek in pain. It was a familiar cry... or was it my own? I felt warm sticky fluid trickling down my back, matting my shirt to my skin. I stumbled, and trying to regain my composure through blurred vision, I prepared to strike again. As I glared up at him, I suddenly realized he wasn't attempting to attack. He simply smiled. Menacingly.
    <br><br>
    More hot breath poured over my shoulder before I could realize what was happening. I jumped to the side out of instinct and that's when I saw him; another monster had joined the alley fight. I wanted to turn and run, but everything happened too quickly for me to react. He leered at me as he brought the weight of his fury down on my minuscule frame and his slender claws tore through my chest like warm butter. The world began to slow as I fell to the ground, gasping for air, my knife dropping from my grasp and clattering at my side. The pain in my chest was blinding as blood poured from the deep gashes, but I couldn't bring my arms to move and stifle the blood loss. The monsters stooped over my body one last time, and I thought they would finish me off then and there. Instead they merely nodded at each other and ran off to battle the rezzies that were just outside the alley. My body felt so heavy, and the sounds around me seemed so far away.
    <br><br>
    The lights around me began to blur together, and a sudden horrifying realization washed over me: I was dying. Could this be the moment I find out I have the same magic in me that the rezzies do? It's not a question I look forward to answering but I suppose I'll be finding out sooner than I thought. Everything had started to feel colder, but at least the pain was going away. I slowly turned my head toward the end of the alley where the rest of the fight had taken place and noticed some blurred movement in the distance, static silhouettes of human-like blobs, though colors and faces were all washed together. Their voices seemed muted and echoey, like someone trying to talk through water. Was that a shout? I can't be sure, it still sounded so far away, even as they approached me. They were still blurry once they reached me, and the words they spoke were a jumbled mess as they fell on my ears. I think they've knelt down beside me, but it's all too dark to tell.
    <br><br>
    The last thing I felt was the brush of fabric against my cheek as they pulled me into their lap and tried to save me.

  <p id="story7" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;"><i>The night of Trohsith <I>44 N.R.</I> I will never leave my mind. All the screaming, all the blood, all the bodies and body parts. The cries of grief, even harder to hear the next morning. The worst of all was the feeling of helplessness. Despite the preparation, it was not enough. Not even close to enough. Hundreds of people lost their life that night. All to those damn werewolves. The damn werewolves and their planned attack the months before. At most, the rezzies only saved a few dozen. I made a makeshift hiding spot, the Lowtown clinic helped hide a few, some put up protection spells. It still wasn’t enough. Not even close to enough. <br><br>
    I had thought myself a hero before that night. Doing my best to help as many of the townsfolk as I could. But I see what the people mean by rezzies now. We are not heroes. Just people blessed or cursed to be able to die and come back. What we are however, are people that can do more. We can do more good for the citizens of Aftermath, or we can do greater evil. What we cannot do is decide what is good or evil in the town’s eyes. Just because we think we are doing good, does not make it so. We saved a handful of people that night, but what about the others that were slaughtered? Others, who were taken from their home? Or the ones that now live with this curse? Did we do enough in their eyes? Did we do good by them? 
    <br><br>
    These are the thoughts ever on my mind as I strive to do more. Protect Aftermath more, protect more crops, protect more animals, protect more land. Most importantly protect more citizens. Protect more of the surrounding people. Protect Aftermath. Do more for Aftermath. <br><br>

The construction of Rose Haven should begin shortly. I tried to help, I tried to call to light the issues plaguing this city to the other heroes but they are too self-conceited. Even our Overseer hasn’t been seen in many a gather. But every day the citizens see the injustices brought by the other heroes, as well as the good done by my thorns. The time is coming where they will be given a choice. All I know is that my thorns will lay their own lives down for any citizen of Aftermath over the life of a hero. I tried to warn them, I tried to form the council. But I am looked down upon, I am shunned, and I am cast aside.

  <div class="container-fluid">
  <p id="story9" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;"><i>Living out in the world as it is now, with the blight the strongest it has ever been, is all but hopeless for humans. But my kinsmen were doing it and had been since Blightfall. The stories I heard as a child told of entire clans of humans, warrior-folk, wiped out in a matter of days because even one with a warrior's spirit couldn't hold off the inevitable spread of the blight. Mother told me we were the remnants, the unlucky handfuls that survived and found one another after the world ended. We came together… or some of us did. Some of our kin ran, took shelter anywhere they could find acceptance and did what they had to do to survive. Others... When our way of life was too brutal, our kinsmen's love of war and strength a liability, they tried still to establish peaceful cities and safe havens. Thus our numbers began to dwindle even further. <br><br>
    Those of us who refused to shed tradition and the old ways in order to assimilate to a more feasible way of life were either killed off within the cities or chose to try and survive within the blight. From those few who chose to face the blight, they struggled and often met with gruesome deaths of their own. Our number grew ever smaller from those deaths. If our people were lucky, if they managed to find one another in the wastes, old clan rivalries were discarded. The things that used to matter to them fell to the wayside in the face of their will to survive, and a desire to protect what they could of the old ways. <br><br>
    They became raiders, taking down cities or towns that had managed to survive in the wastes, honoring their war-talents as best they could and keeping ahead of the blight by never settling in one place for too long. Scout them out, test the waters, and plan. Kill every man, woman, and child within unless you can find a use for them. Use up what resources we can and take the rest with us. Then move on. Our way of life changed, as quickly as others had to struggle and form new ways to survive of their own. And so this is what became of the clans. Battered and broken, to be made anew by the few warriors able to build up a meager existence. <br><br>
    But Mother said that it made us stronger, more clever. She said that nothing makes you stronger than battling a losing battle against an undefeatable foe such as the blight. She was a brave woman, and I always thought it curious that she called us the <I>”</I>unlucky ones” when she never acted down on her luck. I didn't understand what she meant at the time, but I do now. We're the unlucky ones not for surviving, not for being strong, but for carrying the burden of remembering those who didn't and weren’t. The older you become the unluckier you are, because the blight is always knocking at our door and no one can escape death forever. Not even heroes. And the burden of memory only grows heavier with time.<br><br>
    Hero... such a funny choice of word for whatever is different in us that brings us back once we've died. The word hero implies some kind of inherent goodness, but there's nothing good about being able to resurrect, nothing that makes you a hero. It just means you get more chances to succeed or fail than those with only one life to live. For some it just means more chances to cause pain, or become a villain to those you thought you were fighting for. <br><br>
    Villains... That's what you become, when you resurrect. To resurrect somehow makes you responsible for all of the world's ills in the eyes of the people around you who can live only once. To them you are supposed to know more, do more, BE more...but you're just like everyone else, struggling against that undefeatable foe and waiting for the next time it knocks you on your ass and takes another part of you with it. <br><br>
    Everyone finds out differently. Finds out if we are mortal or if we are what others have mistakenly labeled as "heroes". Some of us through accidents, some through violence. For me, it was both. <br><br>
    We were celebrating the night it happened. We had taken a new town with new rewards for us to reap the benefits of. Everyone had fallen asleep, save for the guards patrolling the streets. We slept deep enough in the town to avoid predators, but close enough to the outskirts that we could hopefully avoid an ambush by other wandering groups. But proximities to either didn't help us when the blight began to crawl into the streets, a thick miasma curling and twisting its dark tendrils and stretching ahead as it crept in on us. Or at least that was what I imagine it looked like. And I imagine that at the age of seven, had I been awake to see it coming I would have screamed, or shaken Mother awake. I would have begged her to come away. But we slept, and the guards were nowhere to be found as the blight crept it’s way inside. <br><br>
    My mother woke first, gasping for breath, muscles spasming as she snatched me up and tried shaking the others awake. She began crying out hoarse warnings to the people in the buildings around us. Shouts quickly filled the air as we evacuated the buildings and made our way out of town. My mother didn't carry me. She made me run like everyone else until blood began to drip from my nose and I saw only darkness. When I opened my eyes again, we were on a hilltop. There was a mother wailing at the loss of her child, while others were stone-faced. Their foreheads pressed against the cooling and unnatural looking flesh of their own dead babes. And they weren't alone. Everyone had lost someone they knew, and those who had been exposed to the blight had no idea how long they'd been exposed or what it would mean. <br><br>
    We watched from the hilltop as the blight slowly encompassed the town we had conquered. The town that only a day ago had meant temporary safety and loot for our proud, strong kin. Now we were forced back into our home, the roadless wandering my people had become adept at navigating. Only this time we had no supplies and a throng of sick people to care for. Our march towards a direction we hoped would bear easy spoils and let us recoup was a long one. One by one my kin began to drop like flies, the sick traveling in the front so that they could set the pace. <br><br>
    Some of the men started fights as they grew weaker or began coughing too much blood. They wanted a warrior’s death rather than to fall to disease. Those that were healthy honored them with the fight they desired, but there was no time to stop and grieve. No time for burials or honoring the dead. We had to press on. The weak die, but the strong press on. My own breathing was a constant rasp, headaches and vomiting wracking my small frame as I struggled for days to breathe. I could see that I was not the only one. <br><br>
    My mother wasn't standing quite as tall, her face and skin were searing hot and yet somehow she was pale like the dead we had left behind. But she carried me, marching at the front of the others and carrying me on her back. She might have been alright, might have recovered quickly, if she weren't so brave. So proud a Mother, to carry me such a long way even as the weight of me sped her own deterioration. By the time we found a village easy enough to clear out, there were only four of the sickly left. Our kinsmen watched over us as best they could. <br><br>
    Open sores had appeared on my skin early on, and they wouldn't seem to heal. My mother's gorgeous hair was starting to come out, though she brushed and combed it to hide it. She was beautiful and strong, my mother. Even when looking down death's corridor. A warrior to the last. The other mothers didn't offer to kill me; they respected my mother too much to suggest that she either couldn't or wouldn't do it herself, though I didn't understand that either until later. But I did understand her tears. They were warm and soothing on my warped and aching skin as my chest rattled wetly with every breath. As I neared my own death. <br><br>
    I cried too, because every breath felt like I were shoving cacti into my chest to see how many I could fit. I cried because I was afraid. And when there was no doubt in my mother's mind that I couldn't outlive the sickness in me, when I could see her grief-stricken look turn to a hollow acceptance, she lifted me into a tight embrace and whispered something soothing into my ear. I wish I could remember what it was she whispered...  have spent years struggling to remember. But all I remember was tasting steel for the first time as she pushed a blade into my chest. I remember the feeling of warmth that spread through me, and it didn't seem to fit the pain that came with it as my heart struggled to beat around the cold metal for a breath longer until I fell into death's arms for the first time. 
    I must have clung to life longer than it felt like, for me to remember it at all. The things that happened between my death and my return from the between place were told to me later when I was a bit older. My mother had held onto me, crying quietly, until my body became ash in her arms and shocked those who had come to help her prepare me for burial. They knew what it meant. She knew what it meant. And she sent someone to scout the area for me to help me find them when I resurrected. While she... she rose and went into the center of town, standing as tall as she was able and drawing her sword. A man answered her challenge, someone I saw her share furs with before. <br><br>
    He was a friend to us, someone who shared in my mother's lust for adventure and her traditions. He drew his sword, putting one leg forward and holding it high. My mother’s bones had become brittle from the sickness in her, and she had constant fever. The waves of dizziness had become overwhelming once she had started to carry me, and constant nosebleeds left her weak. She was close behind me on the journey to the grave, and she wanted what most of our kin had on the trek here. To die fighting rather than feebly in bed, and to die before her daughter could witness it. <br><br>
    That's what they told me later. The only reason she could have decided to rush the matter. But if that is true, then she failed. Because my mother, so strong even then, was still fighting when I resurrected. I came through the circle inside the village we had cleared and were camped in. My body was whole, and new. My pain was all gone, my eye keen again and my muscles strong and young again. The blight hadn't followed me through death, and after the shock left me I realized in my child's mind that I was indeed alive, and I took off running. <br><br>
    I wanted to see her, to tell her I was okay, to tell her everything was okay. If I came back she could as well. I was certain of it. She didn't have to be sick any longer. I skidded to a stop, kicking up dust at the edge of my circled kin. When they saw me they tried to grab me and keep me away. But I was just as willful as the woman they were watching. I kicked. I bit. I threw myself past them, and the breath rushed out of me all at once. <br><br>
    My mother’s remaining hair and the fur around her shoulders were soaked in blood from the fight she had lost, a mixture of her blood and his. She was on her knees and I stood frozen as he raised his blade and drove it down into her skull. I was gripped by horror, as any child is when watching their mother die. But then a sense of joy filled me. Her suffering was over, she could come back like me now. New, and alive again. I ran to her and wrapped myself around her, blood soaking onto me as I waited. And waited. But she didn't become ash like heroes are supposed to. The only ash was the taste of ash in my mouth as she grew cold in my grip. My elders began to try and reason with me, to get me away from her so that she could be taken care of. I didn’t let go. I wouldn’t let go.<br><br>
    My mother's friend finally grabbed me, and forced me away from her, dragging me as I screamed things at him that I regret to this day. Because it was him, the man who cleaved her skull open, that took me under his wing in her absence. And it was me that killed her. 
    If I'd just been a little older, a little stronger. A little more like her. If I hadn't been a child, she wouldn’t have carried me. She wouldn't have advanced her sickness for a child who, as it turned out, was better off dying from the start because resurrection was my only cure. I didn't feel like a hero. Because resurrection doesn't make heroes. <br><br>
    I think that how we die that first time can shape who we are, who we become. I think that, if we are honest, only the first time matters and is real. Every death after that makes us hollow. It makes us emptier every time we come back, as if a little piece of us gets left behind each time until finally we stop returning. It drives us mad. You have to be hollow, or mad, to throw away your life... right? 
    And that's what heroes do. They die over small things, petty squabbles, offering their lives up like bartering tools instead of what they are: LIFE.<br><br> They should rail against each death, claw their way out of each circle and say, <b>"I WILL NOT DIE AGAIN"</b>, and fight for that to be the case. I will. I have to. <br><br>Too many times have I seen the sadness in Izrael's eyes when he knows my life is ending. I've seen it in all their faces, when I die. The same look she gave me in the last days of my sickness. I will not die again. They will not die again. Let the other fools barter away all of their lives for mediocrity. They're like children, weak and undeserving. We will not carry them. For us, every step away from the circle is another day that we will not die again... no matter the cost.</i>

  <div class="container-fluid">
  <p id="story10" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">Motion sickness washes over me. Or it would if I had a body or even living for that matter as I am the black skull. My eyes slowly open as I am being held by a reckless straad man. He seems to be running from something by the sound of his frantic breathing. My vision fades as the magic that once kept me sentient fades. But my hearing still works as I can hear the man blabber on about the crone <I>”</I>Please hear my plea, Crone. As I hold your mantle of power. Give me a safe haven from those that seek to harm me.” My eyes open again as the crone grants the man’s wish. My eyes glow red as I summon the legba shop. <br><br>
    Before the straad’s eyes, an odd-looking chicken coop on large chicken legs is built. Each branch slams into one other, breaking into the precise sizes needed to create the shop. The straad does not wait for the stairs to be created, for as soon as he takes a step each step is made as soon as his foot touches it. He makes his way to the door and grabs the chicken’s head that is in the place where a knob would be. The chicken clucks as he twists its head. <br><br>
    He runs in and slams the door. Inside the chicken coop is an old magic shop. The windows show an old city that the straad recognizes as Piloris. The shop is full of books, herbs, trinkets, and crystals of many sizes and colors. He looks to the glass L shaped counter where the storekeeper normally resides. He quickly realizes no one else is present in the shop. <br><br>
    The Straad looks around, remembering the last time he was there. He smiles from behind the cloth wrap that only covers his nose and mouth. <I>”</I>I guess no one is here to stop me from stealing all this stuff.” <br><br>
    A sinister laugh echoes through the shop as a broken man emerges from the shadows of a corner. One arm is a translucent blue and half of his face is rotten off to the bone. <I>”</I>Alex?” the straad asks. The man smiles at the straad <I>”</I>It’s been awhile, Baal.” <br><br>
    My eyes once again glow red as I hear a voice I have not heard in a very long time. My voice has not been heard since I was a living being maybe a few hundred years ago. I never had the will to speak until now. <I>”</I>Son.” The voice is low and weak. But it is heard.

  <div class="container-fluid">
  <p id="story11" class="container-fluid" style="display: none; background: white; padding: 15px; border-radius: 10px;">Long ago, before the Elven city was sealed away, there was a small family of Elven healers. The mother of the lot was one of the greater healers of the city; she helped people from all over, no matter the race or reason. Her name was Ginovine Feothan. This healer had a husband, Pharom, and two sons named Alosrin and Itham respectively. Together they lived and would heal and help whenever they could. That was until the threat of the blight became too much for the city to handle. When word spread of the sealing, chaos ensued within the family. Alosrin, along with his first wife Merildia, wanted to leave the city before the barrier was constructed. The Grand Mother disagreed; she felt the need to stay in the city to attend her duties. The two argued day and night, week and week; until Alosrin took it upon himself to take his newly formed family out of that city. In one hand, he held his pregnant wife, in the other he wielded a sword. With few words of goodbye, he left the city, aware that he was abandoning safety for the price of freedom. 
    <br><br>
    Months were spent wandering those desolate lands, taking shelter where it could be found. Months turned into years, and the blight seemed to worsen and weaken as they travelled the land. However, on a cruel winter night, disaster struck the small family. The family had decided to reside in a small travelling troupe, safe in numbers but scarce in resources. The daughter of the two, Mafiaor, was only ten years of age and barely able to understand the world and it’s happenings. It was in this troupe that the young Mafiaor gained a passion for fighting and surviving, but it didn’t last long. The mother had borne another child; this would have been a blessing and celebration in the safety of the city, but they were no longer in their home. The mother had birthed a baby boy after several harsh days of labor. But with new beginnings, something must close out; Merildia had slipped into the icy grip of death just as her son let out his first cry. The troupe was small, and had a very harsh rule about population: if there was no mother to take care of the child, to keep it safe and quiet, the child was not to come with them. 
    <br><br>
    Faced with a decision a father should never have to make, Alosrin had to choose what was best for his and his daughter’s safety. With howling, icy winds against his back, the father of two marched through the night, the baby boy safe in his arms while his daughter was fast asleep. When the sun rose the next morning, there was a small, freshly dug grave next to his late wife’s own resting place. A small stone with a crudely hand carved message for both his son and his wife lay in between the two: <I>”</I>Merildia and Samme: with the stars you rest.” There in front of the graves Alosrin sat for most of the morning, staring out at the fresh dirt in solemn content. Mafiaor was never told about what the father had done, not until after the two made their home in Aftermath. 
    <br><br>
    Mafiaor, upon hearing about the grim deed the father committed, was not content to sit still in that city. What little respect she had left for her Father dissipated when he remarried to an elf that was younger than his own daughter. The new wife, Ysabelle, was a smalltime merchant; Mafiaor, much to her disliking, had agreed to help out the second wife with the merchant business. The Father managed to get a job as a wine maker’s apprentice, stating he never wanted to go back to healing, that he never could. For several years this arrangement went on and despite the tension, an understanding had become clear; they were all just trying to survive in an unforgiving world, just by different means. With the combined income, land was purchased, and so began the Feothan brewing company. The plot grew and grew, having a farm large enough to provide for the family and supply the business. Ysabelle provided the family with another child after many years, this time a little girl by the name of Elk. Mafiaor, by this time, had joined the guards, and helped protect the city. However, the Father and Mafiaor had grown farther apart than ever. After a nasty falling out years later, she packed up and left for Tsan, a distant city far from Aftermath. That was the last they heard from her until twenty years later, when a letter was shipped to the prospering family. 
    <br><br>
    When she had arrived at Tsan, Mafiaor quickly became a mercenary, and a great one at that. Oftentimes she was hired as a bodyguard for a thin, sickly young Elf. His name was Ricon Wildroot, and he was the son of a small guild leader. At first they hated each other, but soon enough the two grew close. They got married and had a son by the name of Lars; and when the guild leader stepped down, Mafiaor took up the position as head of the small fighters guild. That was the last time the Feothan’s heard from the eldest sibling; a letter was sent back talking of the newest sibling, a boy called Elias, and was a request for Mafiaor to come back home. However, it was never replied to. For a quarter of a century, Mafiaor has been living happily in Tsan, while the Feothan family continues residence in Aftermath.
